Graphing the YPC of various running backs in the NFL

This is a football analytical tool that attempts to make more sense of the Yards Per Carry (YPC) stat. This stat is the average yards gained of a player's rushing attempts, often averaged over a season. This statistic becomes misleading though, as we do not know the consistency (many medium runs vs. many short runs + a long run) of a running back's performance.

By displaying a histogram of every touch a player took, we can better understand how well a player is performing in a given offense. This tool is especially valuable in comparing two rushers on the same team, to spot trends and stylistic differences.
