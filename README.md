Graphing the YPC of various running backs in the NFL

This is a football analytical tool that attempts to make more sense of the Yards Per Carry (YPC) stat. This stat is the average yards gained of a player's rushing attempts, often averaged over a season. This statistic becomes misleading though, as we do not know the consistency (many medium runs vs. many short runs + a long run) of a running back's performance.

By displaying a histogram of every touch a player took, we can better understand how well a player is performing in a given offense. This tool is especially valuable in comparing two rushers on the same team, to spot trends and stylistic differences.

##Examples (2015 season, up to week 4)

> Here we see that Adrian Peterson is performing almost exactly the same as he did in 2013 - preferring 2 and 4 yard runs, apparently.  


![R.Hillman,C.Anderson](http://i.imgur.com/9rAPzfW.png)
> Which runningback in Denver is doing better (or, who isn't the worst)? If you remove Hillman's 72 yard run against Minnesota, they have comparable average YPC, but you can see that Hillman doesn't drop off like CJ from the line of scrimmage.  


![G.Bernard,J.Hill](http://i.imgur.com/csvsY12.png)
> As for Cincinnati, Gio Bernard's average YPC is very uniform. Because of this, I think Bernard is a great 3rd and a short option, since he can reliably achieve yardage near his average YPC.
